This final project of Virtual Reality course is created under the request from Manuel E. Hernandez, a professor in Kinesiology & Community Health. Falls are a significant and prevalent problem in older adults, particularly those with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. However, adequate fall risk assessment is often not possible in rural settings, due to the distance needed to travel to a resident’s home and lack of interdisciplinary team working with the patient. The project aims to develop a framework for using video data for reconstruction of patient-specific home environments, for both the evaluation of fall risk and assessment of fall risk changes. 

The project models one room in Clark Linsey Village (West Windsor Road, Urbana, IL) to 1:1 scale. There are two rooms in the VR enviornment: a safe room where all the furnitures are well organized, and a dangerous room where there are many fall risks.

This folder contains:

1. The Fall Risk Assessment VR Unity Project Folder.
	Controls
	- Use both the left and right Oculus touch controllers.
	- The left joystick is for movement around the room.
	- You can grab with either hand using the grip triggers on the controllers.
	- You can switch between the "safe" room and the "dangerous" room by pressing tab on the keyboard.

2. CS498VR_Step-by-step Guide
	- This is a documentation of our entire design process for this project.
	- It is intended for future groups doing this Fall Risk Assessment to follow and improve upon.
